			Over winter break, I was bombarded with questions about my first semester at college. Naturally, I responded with smiles and nods, hoping to skip the typical holiday small talk. Unfortunately, the question I couldn’t so easily avoid was “What’s your major?” I tried my best to make “Undecided” sound fresh and exciting, but to no avail. Just as my relative-turned-interrogator started to give up, I dazzled him or her with my non-academic major, celebrity stalking, and my favorite book from the semester, Lauren Graham’s Talking as Fast as I Can.
